Additional Comments:

Your JavaScript looks great! Everything is working. Nice!

Be careful about keeping your file structure when you upload stuff to GitHub. In your HTML and CSS, you linked everything like homework.css was in the css folder. But that file wasn't in the css folder, so your code didn't work at first. I imagine it was working on your computer, and you just accidentally moved stuff around when you put in on GitHub. It's an easy mistake to make. Just make sure to keep everything in the correct folders when moving it.

The only other little thing is that in your JavaScript, you have
  $("#city-type").val("");
in line 10, and then again in the conditionals. It's not doing any harm having it in multiple times, but you don't need it. Just having it once on line 10 does the same thing. (And nice job resetting the text like that!)

Overall, your JavaScript looks good! Let me know if you have any questions.
